          <p>
            I am a 21 years old French citizen, 4th year E-Commerce and Digital Business student at the EDHEC Business School of Nice and I love music - Acoustic is my absolute favorite. My objective, once graduated, is to take a year off in order to experience two 6-month - or a one-year - internships and learn more about the professional world. In fact, my short term goal is to integrate a Master program and fine-tune my Digital knowledge. I acquired a good understanding of major digital trends during my career path. From artificial intelligence and Big Data to blockchain, or from machine learning and self-driving/electric vehicles to the Internet of Things. I feel that we are surrounded by outstanding tools, waiting to be used to answer the main evolution’s problematics. <br>

            Before my Master 1 at EDHEC, I majored in Sciences at the Mont-Saint-Jean High School of Antibes - France. I have always been attracted to the challenges that Science in bringing to everyday life. I am also fascinated by the its importance in all kind of field, from technology, to sustainability, from health to human behaviour. I decided to specialised myself in Digital Marketing because it is a sector that is constantly evolving. I have always hated complacency and routine and tried my best to steer away from comfort zones. In this way, Digital Business is for me the perfect sector to thrive.
